Movie Recommendation System

This Movie Recommendation System is a simple application implemented in Python with both command-line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It allows users to manage a list of movies by adding new movies, searching for movies by title or genre, recommending top movies based on ratings, deleting movies, and displaying all movies in the system.

Recommend Top N Movies: Users can get recommendations for the top-rated movies based on a specified number.
Delete Movie: Users can delete a movie from the system by entering its title.
